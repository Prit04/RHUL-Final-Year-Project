# Final Year Project Diary

### 30/09/2024

The inital ideas for this game are that it is to be built in a game engine such as Unreal or GoDot. Research into both of these have been doen but more thorough work is to be done. 
Ideas for the game are a FPS, drawing inspiration from titles such as Doom or Halflife. Other ideas do include topdowm dungeon crawlers with puzzle based elements. 


### 02/10/2024

With much consideration to the ideas and functionaltiy of both engines i have decided on using GoDot. This engine is more suitable for me and this proejct and alligns with the skills i posses to excel with some of the concepts. The documentation for this engine has been read and tutorials provided have been attempted.
Further with this the project plan will be started, finding relavent books and papers to aid in my work.


### 04/10/2024

On the 3rd of october i had met with my supervisor and discussd the project ideas that i had come up with and talked about any relavent help with the project plan. Following this a draft plan has been started.


### 07/10/2024

The plan timeline has been drafted up and the abstarct has been partially drafted too. Research into relavent papers has also been conducted with papers such as 'Designing procedurally generated levels' - Linden, R., Lopes, R., & Bidarra, R. (2021). Designing Procedurally Generated Levels. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment, 9(3), 41-47. https://doi.org/10.1609/aiide.v9i3.12592. Risks and mitigations for those risks have been drafted into the day book.


### 08/10/2024

The risks and mitigations section of the project plan has been completed. Once other parts of the plan are complete a draft will be sent to my supervisor for any final comments and tweaks and will be changed. with this, the timeline will now be started, building upon the initial draft i did for it. Abstract is still to be finished as the bibliography for it is still limited.


### 09/10/2024

The timeline for the project has been completed, with specified milestone and mapped to the term weeks. The abstarct still needs work and further research is being conducted. Once a rough abstarct is complete, i will send it to my supervisor for comments, and with these, on the 10th the plan will be completed, ready for submission on the 11th.
<br /> <br /> I have sent what i have done of the plan so far to my supervisor for further guidance, once feedback is recived from them, i will continue in the correct direction.


### 10/10/2024
I have recived positive feedback about my plan from my supervisor with further tips to finish off the abstract and bibliography. Work on this is underway and should be completed by tonight. Further research on papers have also been done.
<br /> <br /> The project plan is pretty much finished. The timeline, risks and bibliography is done, the abstract is almost finished, it needs a touch up and a bit more writing and the plan will be ready for the submission. Once done, the IDE will be setup and coding will begin.


### 11/10/2024

The project plan has been completed and uploaded to moodle. Now that it is complete, the coding for the game will begin.
<br /> <br /> The file has also been uploaded to the Gitlab documents directory.
<br /> <br /> The interim report will be drafted once the coding starts.


### 13/10/2024

The Godot IDE is setup, linked with the gitlab, a master branch has been created for the inital work to begin. I wil start,a s stated in the project plan, with the games menu screens. I have created the buttons with a control node, and have attched a script to allow for fucntionality of these menu buttons, this is not finished yet.


### 14/10/2024

I have created placeholder menu screens such as the main menu, game screen, and the options menu. I have partially scripted the menu buttons to be connected to each screen when they are pressed.
<br /> <br />I am facing an error while getting the buttons to correspond to their appropriate screen, the change_Screen functions.
<br /> <br />I have relalised the documentation i was using was for Godot v3 and not v4 which is the version i am using. in v3 they used just change_scene, whereas in v4 they chnaged it to change_scene_to_file("..."), which now works. i will now refer to using the v4 documentation, opposed to the v3 which i wrongly opened. The buttons for the main menu screen now have functionality and take the me to the correct screen. I will now begin on creating a back button for the menus and visually sort them out.
<br /> <br />I have centred the main menu buttons and gave them lables.
