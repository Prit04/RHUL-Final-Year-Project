The inital ideas for this game are that it is to be built in a game engine such as Unreal or GoDot. Research into both of these have been doen but more thorough work is to be done. 
Ideas for the game are a FPS, drawing inspiration from titles such as Doom or Halflife. Other ideas do include topdowm dungeon crawlers with puzzle based elements.

With much consideration to the ideas and functionaltiy of both engines i have decided on using GoDot. This engine is more suitable for me and this proejct and alligns with the skills i posses to excel with some of the concepts. The documentation for this engine has been read and tutorials provided have been attempted.
Further with this the project plan will be started, finding relavent books and papers to aid in my work.
